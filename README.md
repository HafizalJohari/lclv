## Core Features

### 1. Real-Time Camera Analysis
- Captures live video feed from the user's camera
- Processes frames at configurable intervals (1-10 seconds or live)
- Uses HTML5 Canvas for drawing overlays and visualizations

### 2. Multiple Analysis Types
The app can analyze various aspects of the video feed:

- **General Analysis**: Overall scene interpretation and context
- **Emotion Detection**: Facial expression and emotional state analysis
- **Fatigue Analysis**: Signs of tiredness using facial indicators
- **Gender Presentation**: Analysis of apparent gender presentation
- **Person Description**: Detailed physical characteristics
- **Accessories**: Detection of worn items and accessories
- **Gaze Analysis**: Eye tracking and attention direction
- **Hair Analysis**: Detailed hair characteristics assessment
- **Crowd Analysis**: Group dynamics and demographic patterns
- **Custom Analysis**: User-defined analysis prompts for specialized use cases

### 3. Custom Analysis Prompts âœ¨ **NEW FEATURE**
The application now includes powerful custom analysis capabilities that allow users to define their own analysis prompts:

- **Custom Prompt Input**: Text field for users to specify exactly what they want to analyze
- **Custom-Only Mode**: Option to use only custom analysis, bypassing all predefined analysis types
- **Flexible Analysis**: Analyze anything visible in the camera feed using natural language prompts
- **Real-time Custom Analysis**: Custom prompts work with live camera feed and video uploads
- **Cross-Provider Support**: Works with all supported vision providers (Ollama, Moondream, Moondream-local)

#### How to Use Custom Analysis:
1. **Enable Custom-Only Mode**: Check the "Use Custom Analysis Only" checkbox (enabled by default)
2. **Enter Your Prompt**: Type your analysis request in the custom prompt field
   - Example: "Count the number of people in the frame"
   - Example: "Describe the lighting conditions and suggest camera settings"
   - Example: "Identify any safety hazards in the workspace"
   - Example: "Analyze the body language and suggest mood"
3. **Start Analysis**: The system will use your custom prompt instead of predefined analysis types
4. **Mixed Mode**: Uncheck custom-only mode to use both custom prompts and predefined analysis types

#### Custom Analysis Examples:
- **Educational**: "Explain what's happening in this scene for a 5-year-old"
- **Professional**: "Identify any workplace safety issues or violations"
- **Creative**: "Describe this scene as if writing a movie script"
- **Technical**: "List all electronic devices visible and their approximate condition"
- **Medical**: "Describe any visible signs of stress or fatigue"
- **Security**: "Note any unusual objects or behaviors in the frame"

### 4. Moondream Station Capabilities
The application leverages the powerful Moondream vision model which provides:

- **Advanced Scene Understanding**: Deep comprehension of visual contexts and environments
- **Multi-modal Analysis**: Combines visual perception with natural language understanding
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for live video stream analysis with minimal latency
- **Precise Object Detection**: Accurate identification and localization of objects, people, and features
- **Contextual Reasoning**: Ability to understand relationships between elements in the scene
- **Adaptive Analysis**: Dynamic adjustment to different lighting conditions and environments
- **High Accuracy**: State-of-the-art computer vision performance for reliable results
- **Local Processing**: Complete privacy with no cloud dependencies

### 5. Dark Mode Support
The application includes comprehensive dark mode functionality:

- **Automatic Theme Detection**: Respects system-wide dark/light mode preferences
- **Manual Toggle**: Users can manually switch between light and dark themes
- **Consistent Styling**: All UI components adapt seamlessly to the selected theme
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Optimized contrast ratios for better visibility in low-light conditions
- **Canvas Overlays**: Analysis visualizations adapt to match the current theme
- **Persistent Preference**: Theme selection is saved and restored across sessions
- **Smooth Transitions**: Elegant theme switching animations for better user experience

### 6. Technical Implementation
- Uses Moondream AI model running locally via Ollama
- Implements caching system for recent analyses (5-second cache)
- Features retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Supports multiple face detection and tracking
- Real-time visualization of gaze directions and connections

### 7. User Interface
- Clean, modern interface using TailwindCSS
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Interactive controls for analysis type selection
- Adjustable time intervals for analysis frequency
- Real-time feedback and visualization overlays

### 8. Performance Features
- Efficient frame processing
- Request debouncing to prevent overload
- Smooth rendering using requestAnimationFrame
- Automatic resizing and responsive canvas

### 9. Privacy-Focused
- All processing happens locally on the user's machine
- No data sent to external servers
- No image storage or persistence

## How It Works

1. The camera feed is captured using the `getUserMedia` API
2. Frames are processed at the selected interval
3. **Analysis Selection**: Users can choose between predefined analysis types or create custom analysis prompts
4. **Custom Analysis**: When custom prompts are provided, they are sent along with the image data to the vision model
5. The image data and analysis instructions are sent to the local Moondream model via Ollama
6. Analysis results are processed and displayed in real-time
7. Visual overlays are drawn on the canvas for features like gaze tracking
8. Results can be interacted with through the UI

The application provides a comprehensive suite of computer vision analysis tools while maintaining privacy and performance by running everything locally on the user's machine. With the new custom analysis feature, users can now analyze any aspect of their video feed using natural language prompts.

## Installation Guide

This project supports multiple ways to run Moondream locally. Choose the method that works best for your system:

### Option 1: Moondream Station (Recommended) ðŸš€
